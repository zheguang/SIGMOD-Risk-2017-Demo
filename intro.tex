In the era of Big Data, visualization arises as an important mean to explore and derive insights from data.  However, visualized information such as relationships and trends may emerge from random noise.  Without proper statistical control, users may mistake visually significant observations as statistically significant.  Worse yet, systems that search and recommend visualized information would produce large number of questionable insights.  
A recent study shows that visualization and recommendation without considering the risk of false discovery, such as Vizdom~\cite{vizdom}, SeeDB~\cite{seedb} and Data Polygamy~\cite{polygamy}, becomes unusable on datasets with any randomness \cite{sustainable-insight}.
