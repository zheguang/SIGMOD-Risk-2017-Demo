\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:concl}

In this paper we presented the first automatic approach to controlling the multiple hypothesis  problem during data exploration. 
We showed how the \system{} systems integrates user feedback and presented several multiple hypothesis control techniques based on $\alpha$-investing, which control \emph{mFDR}, and are especially suited for controlling the error for interactive data exploration sessions. 
Finally, our evaluation showed that the techniques are indeed capable of controlling the number of false discoveries using synthetic and real world datasets. 
However, a lot of work remains to be done from  creating and evaluating other types of default hypothesis over developing new testing procedures (e.g., for interactive Bayesian tests) to investigating techniques to recover from cases where the user runs out of wealth. 
Yet, we consider this work as an important first step towards more sustainable discoveries in a time where more data is analyzed than ever before.
