\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Visual data exploration and recommendation examines large number of observations, and if not correctly controlled, would mistake visually significant results as statistically significant.  Recent theoretical advance in multiple comparison problem and control procedures adds the desirable property of interactivity to data exploration~\cite{zhao2016controlling}.  \system{} implements these interactive procedures. The pen-and-touch userface interface provides a smooth user experience.  The \system{} backend combines functional reactive programming and progressive approximation to achieve practical interactivity and scalability.
