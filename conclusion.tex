\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Visual data exploration and recommendation systems allow users to examine large number of observations either manually or automatically. 
If not treated as hypotheses and correctly controlled, visually significant results might be mistaken as statistically significant. 
Recent advance in multiple comparison problem and control procedures adds the desirable property of interactivity to false discovery control for data exploration~\cite{zhao2016controlling}.  
\system{} implements these interactive procedures and exposes them through a pen-\&-touch UI that allows for explicit and implicit formulation of hypotheses and user-driven steering of visualization recommendation.
